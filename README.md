# MACHINE LEARNING FOR LOCATION CHOICE: CITY OF MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD COMPARISON

## Introduction

This project is completed as part of IBM’s Data Science Professional Certificate course offered by Coursera.org. One of the purposes of this capstone course is to understand what data scientists go through in real life when they need to come up with a data-driven solution to a given problem. Therefore, for this project, a scenario was assumed where an entrepreneur wants to open a Indian Restaurant in the City of Miami, Florida. Given the presence of tourists throughout the year, Miami city is a great location for a Indian Restaurant business. The city of Miami is divided into many neighborhoods. These neighborhoods have hundreds of venues and among these venues, there exist some Indian Restaurants as well. This project will look for neighborhoods where there is little or no presence of Indian Restaurants to find an untapped neighborhood’s market of Miami. Through using Foursquare’s geographic data and one of the machine learning tools, this project aims to help the entrepreneur finding a suitable location for the Indian Restaurant.

## Business Problem

One crucial decision for opening a Indian Restaurant is to find a suitable location and much of the business success relies on it. The entrepreneur needs to know where exactly in Miami city he should set up the station. Intuition wouldn’t help him that much and that’s why the decision needs to be taken based on what data says. The output of this project will help him find a suitable location. By using data science methods and techniques along with machine learning algorithms such as K-means clustering, this project aims to give solutions to answer the business question: In the city of Miami, if an entrepreneur wants to open a Indian Restaurant , where should he open it?

## Target Audiance

The analysis would help any automotive fuel company or an entrepreneur from the city of Miami who considers opening a Indian Restaurant franchise among the city’s neighborhood.

## Data Description

Data used in this project is collected from several sources. A brief description of the sources of data are given below:

The list of neighborhoods along with their geographical coordinates from the city of Miami, Florida (“List of neighborhoods in Miami”, 2020-Wikipedia).

Foursquare API to explore venue types surrounding each neighborhood of the city of Miami. The query was made for the number of venues in each category within a 1000m radius around each neighborhood (“Documentation — Foursquare Developer”, 2020).
